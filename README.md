This project demonstrates a cloud-connected IoT system using an ESP32 (TTGO LoRa32) and an AHT20 temperature & humidity sensor, integrated with a Flask web server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The ESP32 collects real-time environmental data via IÂ²C (SDA: GPIO21, SCL: GPIO22) and transmits it to the cloud over Wi-Fi, including support for mobile hotspots. Data is sent using HTTP GET requests to the server, which listens on port 5000 and is capable of parsing and displaying the sensor values directly in the terminal.

The setup includes features like manual DNS configuration, extended timeouts, and support for both IP-based and domain-based requests, ensuring stable and secure communication between device and cloud. This lab combines IoT sensor acquisition, network communication, and cloud infrastructure, providing a complete end-to-end solution and serving as a solid foundation for scalable smart systems and cloud-integrated applications.
